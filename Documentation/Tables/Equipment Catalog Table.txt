🧾 Purpose of Equipment Catalog:
It’s a simple reference/master data table — like a lookup table for predefined options. It stores static or semi-static records like “Laptop,” “Monitor,” etc.

🧱 Best Practice:

Do not extend from Task (that’s for records needing workflow/state/SLA/etc.)

Do not extend from cmdb_ci unless you're building a full-blown asset/configuration management model (which is not the current goal)

📦 Table: Equipment Catalog
Full Table Name: x\_1778869\_it\_eq\_equipment\_catalog
Extends: None (this is a reference/master data table, so no need to extend Task)
